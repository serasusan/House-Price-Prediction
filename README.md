Learning about Regression in Supervised Learning
- 2 main types of ML
    1. Supervised ML
    2. Unsupervised ML
       
- Supervised ML

  - InÂ **[supervised learning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/supervised-machine-learning/)**, the machine is trained on a set of labeled data, which means that the input data is paired with the desired output.
  - The machine then learns to predict the output for new input data.
  - Supervised learning is often used for tasks such as classification, regression, and object detection.

Types of Supervised ML Algorithms

- Regression
    - Regression is a supervised learning technique used to predict continuous numerical values based on input features
    - Such as predicting house prices based on features like size, bedrooms, and location.
    - The goal is to minimize the difference between predicted and actual values using algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Neural Networks, ensuring the model captures underlying patterns in the data.
- Classification
    - Classification is a type of supervised learning that categorizes input data into predefined labels.
    - It involves training a model on labeled examples to learn patterns between input features and output classes.
    - In classification, the target variable is a categorical value. For example, classifying emails as spam or not.
